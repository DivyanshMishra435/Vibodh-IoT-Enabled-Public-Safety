# Vibodh-IoT-Enabled-Public-Safety

Project Name: VIBODH â€“ IoT-Enabled Public Safety

Public Code Repository Link:
https://github.com/DivyanshMishra435/Vibodh-IoT-Enabled-Public-Safety/tree/main

Prototype Summary:
VIBODH is a real-time gas detection and public safety system designed for the Ujjain Mahakumbh 2028. Using a 32-bit microcontroller and multiple MQ-series sensors (MQ2, MQ4, MQ135, MQ5, MQ7), the system detects LPG leaks, fire hazards, and monitors sanitation in public toilets. A live dashboard logs and displays sensor readings in real-time, enabling instant alerts and monitoring without interrupting data collection.

Key Features:

Real-time detection of fire, LPG leaks, and sanitation hazards.

Continuous data logging with no loss.

Live web dashboard for instant visualization.

Safety alerts when gas or fire levels exceed thresholds.

Clear sensor identification (MQ2, MQ4, MQ135, MQ5, MQ7).

Portable and cost-effective solution for mass gatherings.

Problem Addressed:
Large public events, like the Mahakumbh 2028, face safety and sanitation challenges due to fire hazards, gas leaks, and hygiene issues in public toilets. Existing systems often lack real-time monitoring and proactive alerts, increasing the risk of accidents. VIBODH provides an IoT-enabled solution to enhance public safety and sanitation, allowing early detection and prevention.

Prototype Overview:
VIBODH integrates a 32-bit microcontroller with multiple gas sensors to create a reliable, continuously logging monitoring system. Users can track real-time sensor readings via a web interface, view historical data, and receive alerts for unsafe conditions. The system ensures fire safety, LPG leak detection, and sanitation monitoring, demonstrating a scalable, low-cost approach for managing safety in large public gatherings.
